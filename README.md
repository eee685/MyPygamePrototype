everything except the pushable works, i think either it is the player not colliding with the pushable, or the pushable not changing positions, or both
also have to make the level selection menu, and make the enemy make the player go back to the menu when the enemy catches the player
treat level1 as a an integration testing example, will make real levels by placing the walls around in different locations
